### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 

I'm a student that is currently interested in a wide array of languages, and the array is ever increasing.

I usually write in Solidity or Typescript, as I prefer the best tool for the job, and nodejs works for nearly everything.

if you have any question, feel free to ask me :)
